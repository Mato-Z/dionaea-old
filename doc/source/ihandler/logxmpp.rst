logxmpp
=======

Additional to local logging, dionaea can send a contionous stream of its
attacks to a xmpp server, which allows creating a distributed setup of
sensors with high detail of information for each attack.

Refer to logxmpp <#logxmpp> and pg_backend <#pg_backend> for more
information about distributed setups using xmpp.
